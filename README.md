# JS-Issue-Tracker
Simple issue tracker application with pure Javascript

Using the input fields for Description, Severity and Assigned To the user is able to enter new issues. The issues are stored in the Browser’s Local Storage.<br>
The list of existing issues is printed out in the bottom area. Here you can see that each issue is printed out with the details of description, severity and assigned to.<br> 
In addition you can see that the issue is identified by a unique issue id. <br>
The issue is a GUID which is generated when the issue is created and stored in the Local Storage as well.<br>
Each issue has a status assigned. By default the status is “Open”. If an issue is resolved the user is able to set the status to “Closed” by using the Close button.<br>
The issue can be deleted from the list (and from Local Storage) by clicking on button Delete.
